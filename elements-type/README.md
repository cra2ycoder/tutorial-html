# Element Types

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements categorized in two ways.
They are:

- [Block-Level Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements)

  - a block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block."
  - A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
  - You can visualize them as a stack of boxes.

- [Inline-Level Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements)

  - Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.
  - An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
